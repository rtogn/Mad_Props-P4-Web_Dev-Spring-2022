 <p> Each member MUST apply a summary of how SCRUM was beneficial to you in terms of
solving all the obstacles that you encountered. Also explain how this methodology will be
   beneficial to you in the future. </p>
  
<p>
  Brett Krokoff: Scrum was beneficial to me because it allowed me to keep better track of my progress. 
  Instead of not knowing how far we were making it or if parts of the prject were taking longer than others we were easily able to schedule around it. 
  I will use scrum towards almost all project approaches I have in the future because it helps me to keep track of progress.

 Robert Tognoni: Consistent orginization is something I struggle with. It is easy to lose track of goals. 
  Scrum helped to keep us meeting and discussing our objectives and meeting our goals as best as we could.
